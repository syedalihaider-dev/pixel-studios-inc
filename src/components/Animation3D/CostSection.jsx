              <h2 className={styles.title}>What Drives the Cost <br />of 3D Production?</h2>
              <p className={styles.description}>
                The cost of 3D production depends on the scope, complexity, and level of execution required to bring your vision to life. A simple rotating product model requires far fewer production hours than a fully animated cinematic sequence with characters and detailed environments. Duration also plays a major role, as a short 30-second showcase differs significantly from a multi-minute brand film, with each stage of production clearly itemized for full transparency.

            The level of detail further impacts cost, with photorealistic rendering and physically accurate lighting demanding more time than stylized visuals. Additional elements like visual effects and professional sound design enhance depth and audience impact, and are quoted separately so you only invest in what the brief truly needs. Turnaround time is another key factor, with standard 60-second productions typically completed within four to six weeks, while expedited timelines are available with transparent pricing to maintain quality without compromise.
