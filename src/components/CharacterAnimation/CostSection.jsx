                Most game trailer studios produce technically accomplished videos. The ones worth hiring produce a video that changes what the viewer does next. The distinction is in the creative brief. We spend more time on the brief than most studios spend on the production plan, because the brief is where the trailer is either won or lost. What does the viewer need to feel? What does the viewer need to believe? What does the viewer need to do? Answer those questions specifically, and the editorial, animation, and sound design choices that serve them become obvious. Skip those questions and produce a beautiful failure.

            We also sign NDAs before briefing conversations begin, work remotely with studios on every continent, and treat a launch date as a hard constraint rather than a planning assumption. If the trailer is not ready when the store page goes live, the launch is not ready. We have never been the reason a launch was not ready.
